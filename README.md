# Kanban Board Frontend

## Overview
This is a Kanban Board frontend project built using React.js (or any other framework you are using). It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. The UI is designed for smooth task organization with multiple columns representing different stages of a workflow.

## Features
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Drag and drop tasks between different columns
- Persistent state management (local storage or API integration)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- User-friendly interface with smooth interactions

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript (if applicable), Redux (if state management is needed), Tailwind CSS / Styled Components
- **Backend (if applicable):** API integration with Node.js, Express, Firebase, or any backend of choice

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-board.git
   cd kanban-board
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev  # or yarn dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
- Click on the "Add Task" button to create a new task.
- Drag tasks between columns to update their status.
- Click on a task to edit or delete it.
- Refreshing the page retains the tasks (if using local storage or backend integration).
